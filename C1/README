A JFlex+Cup implementation for the C- programming language.


  To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "Main".

  To test source code like "fac.cm", type 
  Scanner:
    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Scanner < fac.cm"
  Parser:
    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main fac.cm" 

  and the syntax tree will be displayed on the screen.
  To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.
