A JFlex+Cup implementation for the C- programming language.

To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "Main".

  To test source code like "fac.cm", type 
  Scanner:
    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Scanner < fac.cm"
  Parser:
    java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM -FLAG FILEPATH
    (FLAG options):
      -a : perform syntactic analysis and output an abstract syntax tree (.abs) 
      -s : perform type checking and output symbol tables (.sym) 
      -c : compile and output TM assembly language code (.tm)
    FILEPATH:
      -not optional
      -file must have a .cm extension

  To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.
